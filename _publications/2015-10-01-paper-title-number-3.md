excerpt: 'Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram data presents a burgeoning area of research, yet navigates through intricate optimization hurdles, alongside the persistent challenge of rendering results interpretable. In this study, we employed a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and utilized a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization and enhancing the modelâ€™s performance and robustness in deciphering emotional states from EEG signals. Our methodology encompasses data pre-processing techniques, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) analysis, applied to EEG data for feature extraction and GA-driven hyperparameter optimization to identify an optimal neural network architecture. This architecture, consisting of Convolutional and Recurrent layers with dropout regularization, is adept at extracting temporal and spatial features from EEG signals while mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, we investigate explainable AI (XAI) strategies to get insight into the decision-making process of our GA-based optimized model. Additionally, rigorous cross-validation ensures the generalization performance of the optimized model across diverse datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with the optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieving an accuracy of 93.28% in classifying 24 different emotions. This study enhances our understanding of emotion recognition systems by examining the intricate interplay between EEG data analysis, CNN-LSTM networks, and Genetic Algorithm optimization. Additionally, it provides practical insights into the optimization of such systems, potentially influencing future advancements in affective computing technologies.'
